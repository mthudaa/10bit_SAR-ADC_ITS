## Modeling issues to be aware of
* Based on the $g_m/I_D$ versus $V_{GS}$ curves, the pfet models look non-physical in moderate and weak inversion. These models should probably not be used for designs with $V_{GS}-V_t < 150 mV$.
* The pfet_01v8 model has unrealistic intrinsic gain ($g_m/g_{ds}$) for long channels (e.g., ~1000 for $L=3\mu m$)
* The fringe capacitances of the pfets (cgsov, cgdov) are on the order of 20-50 $aF/\mu m$. This is unrealistically small.
